## [1. DriveToMovie](./1_DriveToMovie)

### Introduction

This project is a heartfelt farewell to my girlfriend of eight years. To create a 
meaningful video tribute, I extracted images from Instagram highlights and organized 
them into a Google Drive folder named after her. This folder already contained numerous 
photos of our time together.

The process involved:

1. Downloading Instagram highlights and uploading them to the designated Google 
   Drive folder.
2. Downloading all photos from the Google Drive folder.
3. Modifying and arranging the photos in chronological order.
4. Creating a video montage with the arranged photos, and adding her favorite poem 
   as the audio track.
5. Enhancing the video for easy uploading to Instagram.

The final video, which I uploaded manually, serves as a beautiful and nostalgic tribute, 
showcasing our journey together.
