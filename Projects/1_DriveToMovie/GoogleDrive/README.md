## 1. [`requirements.txt`](\requirements.txt)

Contains the necessary Python modules to be installed for the project. Make 
sure to run 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
to set up the environment.


## 2. [`main.py`](\main.py)

The main script for handling Google Drive operations. It performs the following tasks:

* Imports required modules and functions from various subdirectories.
* Uses `argparse` to parse command-line arguments.
* Initializes `GoogleDriveClient` and interacts with Google Drive to get 
folder IDs and files.
* Manages file downloads, modifies images, creates videos, and applies audio 
processing.
* Displays messages using cowsay to indicate the start and end of the project.

Here's a quick breakdown of the script:

### 2.1 Imports:

* Imports from `google_drive`, `file_handling`, `image_processing`, 
`video_processing`, and `audio_processing` subdirectories.
* Imports `sys` and `path` from the `os` module to manage paths.
* Uses `cowsay` for display messages.

### 2.2 Functions:

* `take_arguements()`: Parses command-line arguments.
* `is_valid_name()`: Validates the folder name.
* `GoogleDriveClient`: Manages Google Drive interactions.
* `manage_files()`: Handles file downloads.
* `image_modifier()`: Modifies images.
* `video_writer()`: Creates a video from images.
* `audiofy()`: Adds audio to the video.
* `video_enhancer()`: Enhances the final video.

### 2.3 Main Workflow:

* Checks if the folder name is valid.
* If valid, it starts processing using `GoogleDriveClient` and other functions.
* If not valid, it displays an error message and instructions for valid folder names.


## 3. `credentials` 

**Not uploaded on here.**

This folder contains files related to authentication and authorization for 
accessing Google Drive API:

### 3.1 `credentials.json`

* **Description**: This file typically contains OAuth 2.0 client ID and client 
secret information required for authenticating and authorizing access to Google APIs.

* **Usage**: It is used to obtain an authorization token for accessing the 
Google Drive API. This file should be kept secure and not shared publicly.

### 3.2 `token.json`

* **Description**: This file usually contains the OAuth 2.0 access and refresh 
tokens obtained after a successful authentication flow.

* **Usage**: It is used to access Google Drive API on behalf of the user. If the 
access token expires, the refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token 
without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

### 3.3 Summary

The `credentials` folder is crucial for managing authentication with Google 
Drive API. It should be handled securely to protect sensitive information.
