## 1. [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt)

Contains the necessary Python modules to be installed for the project. Make 
sure to run 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
to set up the environment.


## 2. [`main.py`](./main.py)

The main script for handling Google Drive operations. It performs the following tasks:

* Imports required modules and functions from various subdirectories.
* Uses `argparse` to parse command-line arguments.
* Initializes `GoogleDriveClient` and interacts with Google Drive to get 
folder IDs and files.
* Manages file downloads, modifies images, creates videos, and applies audio 
processing.
* Displays messages using cowsay to indicate the start and end of the project.

Here's a quick breakdown of the script:

### 2.1 Imports:

* Imports from `google_drive`, `file_handling`, `image_processing`, 
`video_processing`, and `audio_processing` subdirectories.
* Imports `sys` and `path` from the `os` module to manage paths.
* Uses `cowsay` for display messages.

### 2.2 Functions:

* `take_arguements()`: Parses command-line arguments.
* `is_valid_name()`: Validates the folder name.
* `GoogleDriveClient`: Manages Google Drive interactions.
* `manage_files()`: Handles file downloads.
* `image_modifier()`: Modifies images.
* `video_writer()`: Creates a video from images.
* `audiofy()`: Adds audio to the video.
* `video_enhancer()`: Enhances the final video.

### 2.3 Main Workflow:

* Checks if the folder name is valid.
* If valid, it starts processing using `GoogleDriveClient` and other functions.
* If not valid, it displays an error message and instructions for valid folder names.


## 3. `credentials` 

**Not uploaded on here.**

This folder contains files related to authentication and authorization for 
accessing Google Drive API:

### 3.1 `credentials.json`

* **Description**: This file typically contains OAuth 2.0 client ID and client 
secret information required for authenticating and authorizing access to Google APIs.

* **Usage**: It is used to obtain an authorization token for accessing the 
Google Drive API. This file should be kept secure and not shared publicly.

### 3.2 `token.json`

* **Description**: This file usually contains the OAuth 2.0 access and refresh 
tokens obtained after a successful authentication flow.

* **Usage**: It is used to access Google Drive API on behalf of the user. If the 
access token expires, the refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token 
without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

### 3.3 Summary

The `credentials` folder is crucial for managing authentication with Google 
Drive API. It should be handled securely to protect sensitive information.


## 4. [`google_drive`](./google_drive)

## 5. [`file_handling`](./file_handling)

This folder contains Python files for managing file downloads and handling 
file creation times. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each file:

### 5.1 [`FileDownloader.py`](./file_handling/FileDownloader.py)

This script is responsible for downloading files from Google Drive and saving 
them locally. It has following functions:

#### 5.1.1 `manage_files()`

* **Purpose**: Manages the file download process. It checks for the existence of 
the download folder, creates it if necessary, splits the file list into chunks, 
and downloads the files concurrently using a ThreadPoolExecutor.

* **Arguments**:
	* `folder_name (str)`: The name of the folder where files will be downloaded.
	* `files (List[Dict])`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary 
	                        contains information about a file to be downloaded, 
	                        including its 'id' and 'mimeType'.
	* `creds (google.auth.credentials.Credentials)`: The Google Drive API 
	                                                 credentials.
	* `chunk_size (int, optional)`: The number of files per chunk to be processed 
	                                by each service instance. Defaults to 500.
		
* **Returns**: `str` The path to the folder where files have been downloaded.

#### 5.1.2 `chunk_list()`

* **Purpose**: Splits a list of dictionaries into chunks of a specified size.

* **Arguments**:
	* `files (List[Dict])`: List of dicts containing information of the files.
	* `chunk_size (int, optional)`: The size of each chunk. Defaults to 500.
		
* **Returns**: `Generator[List[Dict], None, None]` A generator yielding lists 
               of chunks.

#### 5.1.3 `download_file()`

* **Purpose**: Downloads a file from Google Drive and saves it to the local folder.

* **Arguments**:
	* `service (googleapiclient.discovery.Resource)`: The Google Drive API 
	                                                  service instance.
	* `fid (str)`: The ID of the file to download.
	* `fname (str)`: The name of the file.
	* `fext (str)`: The extension of the file.
	* `downloading_path (str)`: The folder to save the downloaded file.
		
* **Returns**: `None`


### 5.2 [`FilesCreatedTime.py`](./file_handling/FilesCreatedTime.py)

This script determines the creation time of files based on both metadata and 
filename patterns. It addresses issues with inaccurate metadata by using filenames 
to extract dates. The key functions are:

#### 5.2.1 `get_actual_createdTime()` 

* **Purpose**: Determines the actual creation time of a file based on its metadata.

* **Arguments**:
	* `file (dict)`: Dictionary containing metadata of the file including 
	                 'createdTime' and 'name'.
		
* **Returns**: `datetime.datetime` The determined creation time of the file.

* **Note**: This function attempts to parse the creation time from the file name 
    using date parsing utilities. If parsing fails, it falls back to the 
    provided 'createdTime' metadata from Google Drive. It then compares 
    the parsed date and the 'createdTime' and returns the earlier of the two.

#### 5.2.2 `match_dates_format()`

* **Purpose**: Extracts date from the filename and returns it in ISO 8601 
               format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS).
* **Arguments**:
	* `fname (str)`: The filename to extract the date from.
		
* **Returns**
	* `datetime.datetime` The extracted date in ISO 8601 format `OR`
	* `None` if no date is found.

* **Returns**:
	* `datetime.datetime` A datetime object representing the extracted date `OR`
    * `None` if no date is found.

* **Notes**: Uses regular expressions to search for and convert the date in 
the filename to a datetime object.

#### 6.1.2 `image_modifier()`:

* **Purpose**: Modifies images in a specified directory by sorting them based 
on the date in their filenames and saving the altered images in a new directory.

* **Notes**: Creates a new directory for modified images if it does not already 
exist. Images are sorted by date and then altered (resized, padded, and desaturated) 
using the `image_alteration()` function.

#### 6.1.3 `image_alteration()`:

* **Purpose**: Alters an image by resizing, padding, and desaturating it.

* **Arguments**:
	* `fname (str)`: The path to the image file to be altered.
	* `counter (int)`: The current file counter used for desaturation calculation.
